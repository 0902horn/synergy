Share one mouse and keyboard between multiple computers.

Synergy is free and open source, so you are free to run the program,
change the program, and redistribute the program with or without changes.

Just use "hm conf" and "hm build" to compile (./hm.sh on Linux and Mac).

For detailed compile instructions and a list of dependencies:

Happy hacking!
